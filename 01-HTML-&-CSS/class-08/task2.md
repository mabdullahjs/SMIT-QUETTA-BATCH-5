# 🚀 HTML Practice Assignment 2 — Beginner Challenge

## 🎯 Objective
To apply fundamental HTML concepts in a more structured project by creating a **personal portfolio webpage**.  
This assignment combines **headings, paragraphs, links, lists, images, tables, forms, div, span, and semantic structure**.

---

## Part 1: Project Setup

1. Create a new project folder named `portfolio-website/`.  
2. Inside it, create the following files:
   - `index.html` (Home Page)
   - `contact.html` (Contact Page)

---

## Part 2: Home Page (`index.html`)

3. Build a standard HTML structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).  
4. Inside the `<head>`:
   - Add a `<title>` for your portfolio.  
   - Add meta tags for `description`, `author`, and `viewport`.  
   - Optionally, link a favicon.

---

## Part 3: Header Section

5. Create a header section using a `<div>` or `<header>` tag that includes:
   - Your name in a large heading (`<h1>`).  
   - A short tagline or profession in a smaller heading (`<h3>`).  
   - A navigation menu with links (`<a>`) to:
     - Home
     - About
     - Projects
     - Contact  

   *(Hint: You can use an unordered list for the navigation menu.)*

---

## Part 4: About Section

6. Add a section titled **"About Me"** using a heading tag.  
7. Include:
   - A short paragraph introducing yourself.  
   - An image of yourself (or any placeholder image).  
   - Use a `<span>` to highlight a few words (e.g., your name or skills) in a different color using inline CSS.

---

## Part 5: Projects Section

8. Create another section titled **"My Projects"**.  
9. Use a combination of **headings**, **paragraphs**, and **lists** to describe 2–3 projects you’ve worked on or imaginary ones.  
10. Each project should include:
    - Project title (`<h3>`)
    - Short description (`<p>`)
    - A link to the project (can be a real or fake URL)
    - Optionally, an image representing the project.

---

## Part 6: Skills Table

11. Add a **table** to list your skills and experience levels.  
    Example columns:
    - Skill Name  
    - Experience Level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)  
    - Years of Practice  

12. Add a **caption** for the table.  
13. Ensure table headers are bold and data is neatly organized.

---

## Part 7: Contact Form (on `contact.html`)

14. Create a separate contact page (`contact.html`).  
15. Add a **contact form** that includes:
    - Name field  
    - Email field  
    - Subject field  
    - Message textarea  
    - A dropdown (e.g., reason for contact: feedback, collaboration, etc.)  
    - A checkbox for newsletter subscription  
    - A submit button  

16. Make sure to include labels for each input.

---

## Part 8: Footer Section

17. Add a `<footer>` at the bottom of both pages with:
    - Your name or copyright  
    - Year  
    - Links to social media (use `<a>` tags with proper URLs)

---

## Part 9: Internal Links

18. Ensure that:
    - The **Home** page links to the **Contact** page.  
    - The **Contact** page links back to the **Home** page.  
    - Navigation links work correctly between sections.

---

## Part 10: Bonus Challenge (Optional)

19. Add a new page named `projects.html` showing all projects in a table or grid format.  
20. Include an image gallery of 3–4 pictures using `<img>` tags.  
21. Use `<div>` elements to organize the gallery layout.  
22. Add inline CSS styles for borders, spacing, or background colors to make it visually appealing.
