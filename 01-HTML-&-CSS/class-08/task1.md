# 🧩 HTML Practice Assignment — Beginner Level

## 🧠 Objective
To practice writing basic HTML structure and using essential tags such as **headings**, **paragraphs**, **lists**, **links**, **tables**, **forms**, **div**, and **span**.

---

## Part 1: Basic Structure & Text

1. Create a new HTML file named `index.html`.  
2. Set up a basic HTML document structure with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.  
3. Inside the `<body>`, add:
   - A main heading for the page title (e.g., your name or a topic you like).  
   - A subheading that describes what the page is about.  
   - A short paragraph introducing yourself or describing the topic.  
   - Add another paragraph that includes **bold**, *italic*, and **underlined** text.

## Part 2: Lists

4. Create an **ordered list** of your top 5 favorite movies or books.  
5. Create an **unordered list** of your favorite hobbies or foods.  
6. Create a **nested list** (a list inside another list) — for example, list different countries and their major cities.

---

## Part 3: Links and Images

7. Add a link to your favorite website — make it open in a **new tab**.  
8. Add another link that points to a **different page** on your website (for example, `about.html`).  
9. Insert an image (can be from the web or your computer) with **alt text** describing it.

## Part 4: Tables

10. Create a table that displays information such as:
    - A list of students and their grades, **or**
    - A list of products and their prices.  
11. Your table should include:
    - A **table heading** row.  
    - At least **3 rows** of data.  
    - **Borders** and proper alignment of text.  
12. Add a **caption** above the table to describe what it represents.

## Part 5: Forms

13. Create a form for collecting user information.  
    Include:
    - A text field for the user’s **name**.  
    - An **email** field.  
    - A **password** field.  
    - A **radio button** group (e.g., gender or membership type).  
    - A **checkbox** for agreeing to terms.  
    - A **dropdown menu** (select tag) for choosing a country or favorite color.  
    - A **submit** button.  
14. Add a heading above the form that says **"Registration Form"** (or similar).

---

## Part 6: Div and Span

15. Use a `<div>` to group together:
    - A heading  
    - A paragraph  
    - An image  
    This represents a “section” of your webpage.  
16. Use a `<span>` inside a paragraph to:
    - Highlight one or two words with a different **color** or **style** using inline CSS.

---

## Part 7: Bonus Challenge (Optional)

17. Create a second HTML page (like `about.html`) and link it from your main page.  
18. Add a footer section that includes:
    - Your name  
    - Copyright year  
    - A link to your social media  

---

## ✅ Deliverable

By the end of this assignment, you should have:
- A well-structured HTML webpage using all the mentioned tags.
- Proper indentation and comments where necessary.
- At least one working link between pages.

### 💡 Tip
Save your project files in a single folder (e.g., `html-practice/`) so all links and images work correctly.
